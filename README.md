Musical Structure
The app allows the user select, in a simple way, the music by decade. It has 3 additional activities, one per decade. 
I stored data, 10 songs per activity, in song objects created with a custom class, inside an Array List. Then, that objects 
are displayed in each list item using a List View and Array Adapter combination.
Finally, I have re sized images in 5 different densities: mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi using Android Drawable Importer.
